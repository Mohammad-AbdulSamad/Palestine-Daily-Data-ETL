## 🚀 Live Dashboard

> 🌐 **[Click here to view the public Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/your-username/viz/PalestineCasualtiesTracker/MainDashboard)**
> *(Auto-refreshes with updated Google Drive CSVs daily)*

---

## 📑 How It Works

1. **ETL script (`etl.py`)** fetches JSON from 6 endpoints
2. Normalizes + stores each as a `.csv` file in `/data`
3. GitHub Actions runs this every 24 hours
4. Updated CSVs are committed + pushed to GitHub
5. Then uploaded to a shared Google Drive folder
6. Tableau Public dashboard is connected to these Google Drive CSVs
7. Dashboard refreshes automatically with new data

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Clone & Run ETL Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-AbdulSamad/Palestine-Daily-Data-ETL.git
cd Palestine-Daily-Data-ETL
pip install -r requirements.txt
python etl.py
```

### GitHub Actions Automation

* Daily cron job: runs ETL + uploads fresh CSVs
* `.github/workflows/daily_etl.yml`

### Google Drive Integration

* Uses a Google service account
* Uploads/replaces CSVs in a shared folder
* Credentials and folder ID are stored as GitHub secrets

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

* Time series: daily killed/injured in Gaza & West Bank
* Pie/bar charts: gender/age breakdown, press/civil defense victims
* KPI: infrastructure damage by type (schools, mosques, homes)
